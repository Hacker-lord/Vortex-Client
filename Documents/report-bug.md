# Report Bugs
If you find a bug, please report it. Here are instructions to help you make the most helpful bug report possible:
1. Title
You need to give it a title that tells us what the bug is. This may sound odd, But the title is one of the most important parts of the process.
2. Write the report.
Now lets actually write this bug report. We want to be able to understand this. Please try not to:
* Mispell Words (yes that was intentional)
* Be vague. We want to know what the bug is. Not just that there is a bug.
* Be angry. If it is an actual bug you are helping us solve it and make the client better. You will get featured.
Please Try **To**:
* Spell things correctly. We want to understand what the bug is. Also please do the report in english. 
* Describe exactly what the bug is. We really want to know what it is.
* **If** you know how to solve the issue, Please include source code that could help. We do not need help, however it would save us some time.
* Be polite. We all like being polite. It makes things simpler.
